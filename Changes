0.15 (07/23/2006)
    (ms) Fixed bug with multiple comment lines, of which only the first
         one was printed in the graph. It was introduced in 0.14. 
         Thanks to Steve van der Burg for reporting and a patch.

         to allow for invisible graphs, just used as base for later 
         'cdef' calculations. Since leaving 'type' out will have

    (ms) Martin Kurahaupo <martin@kurahaupo.gen.nz> added a patch
         to prevent the test suite from failing when run as root

    (ms) Chris Fedde <cfedde@denver.pm.org> provided a patch to 
         structure ::info's output more perl-like. Got input from
